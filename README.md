# Study of CNN with Pytorch

Study of CNN with Pytorch using basic CNN, a pretrained CNN (resnet18) with different training methods (one with no frozen layer one with all layers frozen except the last one)

You will also find the con_env used when I made the study, all, the packages are not useful. To recreate the env: `conda create -n name-env -file conda_env.yml`
